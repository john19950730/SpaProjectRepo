# SpaProjectRepo - Iteration 1 Prototype Stage

Our project focuses on developing a C++ project that does static program analysis known as SPA. It is a tool to do program analysis for a programming language called SIMPLE. The SPA are used to answer program queries written in Program Query Language known as PQL.

###### Currently our prototype is able to do the following:
- Get results from "Select" synonym
- Evaluate "Follows" queries
- Evaluate "Follows*" queries
- Evaluate "Modifies" queries
- Evaluate "Parent" relationship clause
- Evaluate "Parents*" relationship clauses
- Evaluate "Pattern" clauses
- Evaluate "Uses" relationship clauses

###### Issue Reporting and Branch Creating
- For anything you want to fix , create an issue
- All issue will come with numbers such as #1
- Always branch out from the dev branch
- Name your branch according to issue number such as #1 in the format of issue-1
- When doing pull request always link to the issue that you are solving to avoid confusion
